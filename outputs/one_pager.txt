THESIS
─────
France faces structural fiscal stress (114% debt, 5.8% deficit) with limited room for 
error. While markets remain calm today, cascading triggers (ratings downgrades, bond 
auction stress, political instability) could rapidly reprrice credit risk. This strategy 
systematically deploys capital when triggers align, capturing crisis alpha without 
front-running uncertainty.

CURRENT STATUS
──────────────
Phase:                    0 (WATCH & PREPARE)
Deployed Capital:         $55M (11% of portfolio)
Trigger Status:           Engine A: 0/3 | Engine B: 0/5
Expected Return (Calm):   -5% to -10% (hedge cost)
Expected Return (Crisis): +$50-100M (+10-20% of portfolio)

PORTFOLIO STRUCTURE
───────────────────
1. Long France CDS 5Y:        $30M → expands to $120M in Phase 2
   └─ Direct credit protection bet; profits if spreads widen
   
2. Short OAT / Long Bund:     $15M → expands to $90M in Phase 2
   └─ Curve arbitrage; captures spread widening
   
3. Bank Put Options:           $0M (Phase 1) → $30M (Phase 2)
   └─ Tail convexity; French financial equities crash in crisis
   
4. FX Hedge (EUR Puts):       $10M (always on)
   └─ Portfolio insurance against EUR weakness

TRIGGERS TO MONITOR (Next 90 Days)
───────────────────────────────────
✓ Budget vote failure          → Political instability signal
✓ Moody's/S&P downgrade        → Confirmation of Fitch downgrade
✓ Bond auction stress          → Market liquidity deterioration
✓ Italian BTP > 250 bps        → Eurozone contagion spillover

ESCALATION ROADMAP
───────────────────
Phase 1 → Phase 2 when: (1+ critical trigger) AND (catalyst event within 10 days)
Deployment: 4-week ramp (25% / 50% / 75% / 100%)
Total capital @ Phase 2: $250M (50% of portfolio)

RISK MANAGEMENT
────────────────
Max Drawdown Tolerance:      10% (exit all if breached)
Profit Taking:               Close 50% @ spread 150 bps
Core Position Hold:          Maintain CDS for tail exposure
Rebalancing:                 Daily trigger monitoring; adjust as catalysts approach

EXPECTED OUTCOMES
──────────────────
Calm Scenario (70% prob):    -5% to -10% loss (acceptable hedge cost)
Crisis Scenario (30% prob):  +$50-100M gain (+10-20% of portfolio)
Timeframe:                   3-6 months to trigger activation
Confidence:                  High (based on structural fiscal stress + institutional demand)

NEXT STEPS
───────────
• Monitor trigger status daily (dashboard updated weekly)
• Track catalyst calendar (budget votes, rating reviews, auctions)
• Prepare Phase 2 escalation documentation
• Confirm counterparty agreements for rapid deployment
• Review exit triggers and stop-loss levels
