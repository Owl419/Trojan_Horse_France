[CURRENT STATUS]
  Phase: 1 | PHASE 1: EARLY WARNING (1 critical trigger, awaiting catalyst)
  
[TRIGGER ENGINES]
  Engine A (Critical):     1/3 triggers active 🔴
    - Debt/GDP ≥ 120.0%
    - CDS 5Y ≥ 50.0 bps
    - 10Y OAT ≥ 3.75%

  Engine B (Supporting):   0/5 triggers active 🔴
    - FR-DE Spread ≥ 100.0 bps
    - Deficit ≤ -5.5% GDP
    - Unemployment ≥ 8.5%
    - Inflation ≥ 3.0%
    - GDP Growth ≤ 0.2% QoQ

[ESCALATION LOGIC]
  Type: CATALYST-TRIGGERED (Trojan Horse)

  Phase rules (deterministic):
    • Phase 0 (WATCH):     0 critical triggers → 0% allocation
    • Phase 1 (EARLY):     1 critical + ≥2 supporting → 10% allocation
    • Phase 2 (DEPLOY):    ≥2 critical → 60% allocation
    • Phase 3 (PANIC):     3 critical + ≥3 supporting → 80% allocation

  Catalyst window considered: 10 days from reference (see CATALYSTS calendar)
  Next catalyst (if found): None

[POSITION SIZING]
  Phase 1 allocation:
    - Total notional: 10% of risk budget
    - CDS allocation:  60% of notional
    - Spread trade:    30% of notional
    - Options/convexity:10% of notional

[RECOMMENDATIONS / NEXT ACTIONS]
  1) If Phase 2 or higher is active, deploy Tiered Execution:
     - Tier 1: Initiate CDS pilot exposure.
     - Tier 2: Scale spread short (OAT vs Bund) as liquidity confirms.
     - Tier 3 (if Phase 3/PANIC): Maximize convex exposure; prioritize speed over finesse.
  2) Legal optionality: maintain claim dossier pipeline under standby for enforcement vector.
  3) Monitoring: refresh triggers daily, rerun Monte-Carlo weekly, alert on catalyst overlap.
  4) Risk controls: enforce stop-ladders, monitor ECB/ESM interventions, automatic unwind on ECB announcement triggers.
